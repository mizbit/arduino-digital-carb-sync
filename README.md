# arduino-digital-carb-sync

Motorcycle carburetor synchronization based on Arduino Uno, Nextion Display and analog pressure sensors.

## the theory

The part of the signal that ramps downward is the intake stroke of the engine. The part of the signal that ramps upward is the compression, power and exhaust stroke combined.

The entire vacuum signal from the intake stroke alone is analyzed for synchronization by finding the min peak of the vacuum. If the min peaks of both cylinders are on the same level, the carburetors are syncronized.
